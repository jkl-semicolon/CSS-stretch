      <p>A brilliant scientist named Will Rodman developed a drug that increased the intelligence of chimpanzees. He adopted a baby chimp named Caesar, who inherited the drug from his mother and showed remarkable cognitive abilities. Caesar grew up feeling isolated from both humans and apes, and he learned to communicate with sign language and a computer. He also discovered his fatherâ€™s secret laboratory and freed other apes who were experimented on. Caesar decided to rebel against the humans who mistreated him and his kind, and he led a massive army of apes to escape from captivity and take over the city. This was the dawn of the rise of the planet of the apes.</p>
